## Overview

Take in a formula and some values and return a numeric score. 

This was going to be a larger undertaking but then I found the excellent [Flee](http://flee.codeplex.com/ "Flee!") library that does pretty much exactly what I wanted to do. It's nice when that happens.

Formula Score is intended for use with the [Compare City](https://github.com/dwfennell/compare-city-2000 "Compare City") web application currently under development. Please see the Compare City repository for updates on that project.

Currently, this code is untested and unintegrated into the larger project so there will likely be some small and/or cosmetic changes to this repo, but don't expect much.
